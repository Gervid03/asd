  - Welcome to your new home!
  - Whether you like it or not, this "place" will be your home until it becames your
    grave!
  - Don't worry tho, it's not that bad down here
  - There are a few survivors, like me who are leaving notes on the walls serving
    as some help to navigate in the dungeon
  - Here for example, you can flick the levers to shift particular types of mana
    in objects
  - You can differentiate manas by their color
  - Hopefully you will be able to join us soon
